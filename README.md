# Pao Lab Git Repo
A git repo to collect and share some tools for professor Lucy Pao's research group at CU Boulder.

## Guidelines
- If you want to add a folder, please include a README describing its purpose and primary functions.
- Please only commit code that is relatively clean and can be easily used by others.
- If other software packages are needed (e.g. [OpenFAST](https://github.com/openfast/openfast)), please make that clear. 
- Well commented code is good code!
